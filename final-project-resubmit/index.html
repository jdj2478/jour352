        one open to help revitalize the local art scene. </h2>

          <div id="story">
            <p> The closing of <a href="http://www.dbknews.com/2020/01/01/milkboy-arthouse-the-clarice-smith-performing-arts-center-closes-route-1-college-park-umd/">MilkBoy Arthouse </a> did not stop The Clarice Smith
            Performing Arts Center from hosting its own events, but it did
            shine a light on the need for a lasting performing arts venue in
            the College Park, Md. community. </p>

            <p>The performance space itself reopened its doors in 2017 as
            MilkBoy Arthouse following the closing of <a href="https://dbknews.com/2016/08/12/article_ffc3e82a-78e8-11e4-b84a-0bc5fa292228-html/">The Barking Dog,</a> which
            was left vacant after it had closed in November 2013 and failed to
            find a new tenant, according to The Diamondback.</p>

            <p> The property's reopening was the result of a "first-of-its-kind"
            partnership between The Clarice and MilkBoy, a Philadelphia-based
            entertainment company.</p>

            <p> The idea of a private company like MilkBoy partnering with a large
            organization, like a university, seemed unprecedented and the
            company's experience with both entertainment and restaurant
            industries made them "attractive" to work with, said Erica Bondarev
            Rapach, the acting executive director of The Clarice.</p>

            <p> "They were music people first and then became interested in the
            idea of the food and beverage side of the business and how they
            might marry those two," Bondarev Rapach said. "They have a lot of
            success with their enterprises in Philadelphia."</p>

            <p>In December 2019, the venue abruptly closed its doors without any prior
            announcement. On the <a href="https://www.milkboyarthouse.com">venue's website,</a> MilkBoy released a statement in conjunction
            with The Clarice that confirms the ending of the partnership.</p>

            <p> The statement said: "We feel it has always been our responsibility
            to be present in the community we value and create opportunities for
            community engagement with our visiting artist program. MilkBoy
            helped pave the way for us to do that in new and innovative ways,
            and we are grateful for their years of partnership." </p>

            <p> Speculation as to why the venue closed began to spread shortly
            after students heard the news, but Bondarev Rapach said the
            decision was not made by The Clarice, but rather between
            MilkBoy and Terrapin Development Company, the lessee of the property.
            She also said from her understanding, the venue had encountered
            financial difficulties.</p>

            <p>"MilkBoy is a small enough enterprise that they just didn't have
            ... deep enough pockets to subsidize what was going on here for a
            long enough term to be able to make it profitable," she said.</p>

            <p> Petey Devaney, a member of the College Park-based band Higher Education, said
            the band had a show scheduled at MilkBoy Arthouse for New Year's Eve before it
            closed. The band found out the venue had closed while they were on tour in
            Vermont three days before the show. </p>

            <p>"Somebody hit me up and sent me something about MilkBoy closing and I looked over
            at my agent, and he said 'Yeah, I didn't want to tell you guys before the show
            but apparently they're closing their doors,'" Devaney said.</p>

            <p> Devaney also said the venue closing did not surprise him because the venue has
            been reopened multiple times, but with performance spaces like The Void, a DIY
            music venue who took on the band's New Year's Eve show, and events like Art
            Attack at the University of Maryland, there are only a few opportunities for
            live music to thrive in the area. </p>

            <p> "Unless you get in with the right niche of people, there's nowhere to play,"
            Devaney said. "It's strange that we call College Park our hometown and we don't
            really have a music scene right now."</p>

            <p> Now operating under the name Arthouse for the spring 2020 semester,
            Bondarev Rapach said The Clarice decided to keep the events they had booked previously
            and even though the venue does not have a functional restaurant or bar area,
            food and non-alcoholic drinks are provided at each event by UMD Dining Services.</p>

            <p> "I think we've learned that the community wants something like this," Bondarev
            Rapach said. "We imagined that space from the beginning to be a space where the
            campus and the community can meet." </p>
