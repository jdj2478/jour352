    <p> I was born and raised in Gambrills, MD, somewhere I consider a midpoint
      between Baltimore and Annapolis. I graduated from Arundel High School in
      2014 and went to Anne Arundel Community College. In my first semester, I took
      an Introduction to Media course, and after telling my professor at the time
      Alfred Hitchcock's film, "Psycho," was the first film to feature a flushing
      toilet, she invited me to join the staff of the campus newspaper, The Campus
      Current. I had never written for a newspaper before, but I accepted her
      offer and found a passion for writing. I was on staff for a year as a
      columnist writing film reviews and what students were listening to when I
      took a year off to focus on my classes. I re-joined the staff as Associate
      Editor in 2016 after a complete overhaul of the paper under a new staff
      supervisor. After one semester as Associate Editor, and in my final semester
      at AACC, I became Editor-In-Chief, where me and my staff put out the first
      20-page print edition in the publication's history. I graduated in May 2017
      with an Associate's Degree in Transfer Studies and I took a semester off before
      I applied to the University of Maryland, College Park, where I have recieved
      an education since January 2018 and major in Multi-Platform Journalism with an
      expected graduation date of December 2020. </p>

      <p> Outside of my education, however, I play in and manage my own band,
      The Vibesmen. The band has been active since September 2015 and has played
      in venues around Baltimore and Annapolis such as Baltimore Soundstage,
      The 8x10, Metropolitan Kitchen & Lounge and Rams Head Live!. I also oversee
      all of the social media for the band and take care of booking our shows and
      the band's finances. In addition to the band, I founded a podcast with one
      of my bandmates called Podcast Hangs. The podcast invites local artists to
      tell their stories and give their thoughts on current events or topics in
      the vein of the "Joe Rogan Experience" podcast.</p>
